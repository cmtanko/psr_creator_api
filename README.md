# PSR Generator API
(Node , Express)

This is the API fhttps://github.com/cmtanko/psr_creator.
Mostly every organization keeps track of the project as daily report or weekly or monthly. Most uses Jira for project management and github for version control. So this psrgenerator generates

**Daily Report** based on that day's commits from git. It will also show the task state completed/InProgress and total time required to do that task and total hours spent on that day
  ** Prerequisite: **
(User should smart commit)
git commit -m "ISSUE-NO -m ISSUE-MESSAGE -t ISSUE_HOURS -s ISSUE_STATE"
eg. git commit -m "PSRG-003 -m Added cronjob npm package -t 1 hr -s In Progress"
    git commit -m "PSRG-003 -m Completed cronjob task -t 2hrs 30m -s Completed"

**Weekly/Montly Report** based on JIRA state. If the state is on 'selected for development' it is marked as 'To Do', 'in progress' = 'in progress' and 'ready for testing' = 'Completed'
